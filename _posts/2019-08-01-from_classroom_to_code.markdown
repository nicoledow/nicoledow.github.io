From Classroom to Code - Why I’m Switching Careers

	Five years ago, I declared a major in French Language at Rutgers University. I didn’t know what I wanted to do after graduation, but I knew I loved the French language and culture more than anything else I had studied.
	
	For over four years my life was consumed with learning languages - mostly French, but also some Spanish and Italian. My eye was always on the prize: to find a job that would be  my ticket to a visa and living in France.
	
	I made it. I worked and studied around the clock and I made it. I graduated with a visa and a job lined up in the small city of Verdun, France.
	
	My time living in France was the happiest I’ve ever been. I found the tiniest and cheapest apartment I could so that I could spend my money on weekends boomeranging around Europe. I felt free - rootless in the best way possible.
	
	But soon, it was time to return home. I missed my family. But I felt so lost. *Now what do I do with that French degree?*
	
	Just two days before I returned to the United States, I received an email from my high school French teacher: *the French position at the middle school is open. Are you interested?* When you’re a lost twenty-three-year-old and an opportunity like this just falls into your lap, you take it.
	
	For a year I convinced myself that I loved teaching. I convinced myself that the hours I spent after school carefully designing units and aligning standards made me happy. I convinced myself that I, an introvert, could handle talking to groups of twenty or more people all day every day.
	
	My second year, the illusion came crashing down. While I will always be grateful for my experience teaching - all the skills it helped me develop, all the people it allowed me to meet - I had to admit to myself that I wasn’t happy. 
	*But French is the only thing I’m passionate about. How will I find something else that I want to do as a career?* This thought kept me awake on many a night.
	
	As with most steps in my life, fate was kind to me. In an offhand conversation, a colleague suggested I try learning to code.
	
	A few Google searches later, I was hooked. I started with simple HTML and CSS, making web pages that were so simple but made me so proud! Then JavaScript entered my life and everything changed. Wow, I can type stuff and it comes to life! It does things! 
	
	I have never considered myself creative - every time I’ve tried to paint, or draw, I’ve just been embarrassed. 
	
> 	Coding felt like being creative when I’d never felt creative before. 
	
	I loved the mix of logic, creativity, and perseverance required to tackle coding challenges.
	
	I made the choice to join FlatIron in March 2019, and (im)patiently waited four months for my cohort to begin on July 15th, 2019. I found myself working through the pre-work during my lunch break, after school, any moment I could. It felt right.
	
	Three weeks into the program, I am feeling confident about my choice to change careers. I am feeling happy. I am feeling positive.
	
	And don’t worry, I still get my daily dose of French. Thank goodness for French series on Netflix!
